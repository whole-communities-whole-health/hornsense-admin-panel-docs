## Admin user login issues
Existing study admins may encounter issues logging into the admin panel. The following steps will resolve the
situation:

1. You should not be sharing a password with anyone. If you are sharing your account with other people, verify that
nobody changed the password and didn't tell you.

2. Clear your browser cache and cookies. 

3. Verify the issue exists on another browser.

4. There is a prod and dev admin panel for each study. Verify you are logging into the correct one. The easiest way to tell which you are logging into is to look at the url at the top of the login page. Also verify that you are using the correct MFA token for the admin panel you're logging into.

5. If you have a new phone, verify you've reinstalled your MFA app correctly. If you're using DUO, a helpful guide is [here](https://ut.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&number=KB0018240).

6. If you have forgotten your password, you will need to have another study admin set up a new admin account for you. There is not a way to reset a forgotten password.
