# General Troubleshooting

Occasionally, the admin panel may run slowly or stop responding. If this occurs, 
there are some general troubleshooting steps you should follow:
1. Close your browser and reopen it.
2. Clear your browser cache, then follow the preceeding step.
3. Sign out, follow the preceeding steps, and sign in again.
4. A browser extension may be interfering with the admin panel. Try another browser 
and see if you have the same difficulty there.
5. Check to see if your browser needs to update. At the university, Firefox and 
Chrome update frequently.
6. Restart your computer.
