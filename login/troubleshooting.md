# General Troubleshooting

Study administrators occationally complain that the admin panel responds slowly
or not at all. If this happens to you, it's usually because your computer is doing 
too many things at once. Here's some troubleshooting steps you can follow:

1. Make sure you're on a good ethernet or WiFi connection.
2. Close browser tabs you aren't using.
3. Close other software programs you aren't using.
4. Close your browser and reopen it.
5. Clear your browser cache, then close/reopen your browser.
6. Sign out of the admin panel, clear your cache, close/reopen your browser, and 
sign in again.
7. Check to see if your browser needs to update. At the university, Firefox and 
Chrome update frequently.
8. A browser extension may be interfering with the admin panel. Try another browser 
and see if you have the same difficulty there.
9. Restart your computer in case your computer is trying to install other updates.
