# General Troubleshooting

Occasionally, the admin panel may run slowly or stop responding. If this occurs, 
follow these steps:  
1. Close your browser and reopen it.
2. Clear your browser cache, then follow the previous step.
3. Sign out, follow the previous step, and sign in again.
4. Check to see if your browser needs to update. At the university, Firefox and 
Chrome update frequently.
5. A browser extension may be interfering with the admin panel. Try another browser 
and see if you have the same difficulty there.
6. Restart your computer.
