## How to set up new admin panel administrators
Existing admins must create accounts for new admins and help with the initial multi-factor authentication set up. This process can be done via video call following these steps:
1. Create the account credentials for the new admin (done by an existing admin)

2. Link the device for the new admin (done by an existing admin)

  * Existing admin clicks `Link Device` for the new admin:

  * The new admin will use `Authy`, `DUO Mobile`, or another MFA app to scan the QR code. 
  * After the new admin scans the QR code, the new admin sends the generated code to the existing admin. The existing admin then enters the code in the `Token` field:

  * The existing admin clicks `Confirm` and the MFA set up is complete. The credentials can then be shared with the new admin. Passwords can be changed using the menu in the top right hand corner of the screen.

## How to change device
After the initial setup, the device can only be changed by the account owner. Other admins won't be able to change the MFA device for you. After you log into the admin panel, click `MFA SETUP` on the top right header:

Use the new device to scan the QRCode, and enter the code in the `Token` field, and then you are done.

`Note: If you lose your old device or forget your password, you won't be able to log into your account. In this case, you will need to have a new admin account created for you.`
